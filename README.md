#Research Objective
The purpose of this study is to create and assess a machine learning model that may effectively detect VAP in ICU patients within the first 72 hours of receiving invasive mechanical ventilation.
Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia is one of the well-understood and most prevalent hospital-acquired pneumonia in the studyâ€™s critically ill population. It is the complication of mechanical ventilation with incidence varying from 9% to 27%
depending on the population of patients and intensive care units [1].VAP has been linked with longer duration of stay in the ICU, higher costs of care and higher mortality rates hence early identification and prevention of VAP is recommended [2].
